## IVR application for health alert

### How does it work

The IVR application utilize [plivo](https://www.plivo.com) to call your cell phone when abnormal sensor data is detected and you are away.

We provide 24*7 healthcare and monitor for you and people you care. We make sure all your abnormal health data are recorded so the doctors can offer better diagnosis and treatment. 

A typical senario is when you are wearing health sensors yet not facing [the main telemed app](http://caas.hwpaas.com/patient/), for example, you are sleeping or on a road trip. If the sensors show abnormal health activity, the IVR app will be triggered and we will call you on your cell to alert you about the abnormality and can make an appointment with your doctor upon your grant.


### We are very serious about your privacy

All we request is your cell phone number so we can call you when emergency struct. We will not disclose your number to other parties under any circumstance. You can setup the alert trigger thresholds in the main telemed app. The ivr app will be informed by the telemed app when there is abnormal data. We are not aware of the actual values.
